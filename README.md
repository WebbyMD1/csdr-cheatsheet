# csdr Cheat Sheet

[csdr](https://github.com/ha7ilm/csdr) is a truly stunning command line software defined radio tool. The command set for csdr is very large and this can make it difficult to look up the commnad you want to use. This cheat sheet is intended to be a simple list that lets you look up commands more easily.
